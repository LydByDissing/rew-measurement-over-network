# Fix for test-runner script - Remove 'set -e' and fix fail() function

# Problem: Script exits on first failure due to 'set -e' and fail() returns 1
# Solution: Let tests continue and exit only at the end based on overall results

# Apply this patch to Dockerfile.test-runner:

1. Change line 27:
   FROM: set -e  
   TO:   set -o pipefail

2. Change lines 51-54:
   FROM: 
   fail() {
       echo -e "${RED}[FAIL]${NC} $1"
       return 1
   }
   
   TO:
   fail() {
       echo -e "${RED}[FAIL]${NC} $1"
       # Don't return 1 here - let tests continue
   }

3. The script already has proper exit handling at the end:
   - Counts TESTS_PASSED and TESTS_FAILED
   - Exits with EXIT_CODE=0 if TESTS_FAILED=0, else EXIT_CODE=1

This allows all tests to run and provides complete test results instead of 
exiting on the first failure.

## 🎵 Enhanced Logging Features

### Audio Flow Detection
```
🎵 Audio detected flowing through REW Bridge!
   Source: REW_Network_Audio_Bridge.monitor
   Format: 48.0 kHz, 16-bit, 2 channels
```

### Periodic Status Reporting
```
📊 Audio Bridge: 10.5 MB processed from REW_Network_Audio_Bridge.monitor
📊 Pi Receiver: 1000 pkts, 1411.2 kbps, status: GOOD
```

### Connection Monitoring
```
🔍 Starting connection quality monitoring...
🎵 REW Bridge Status: Virtual device active, monitoring for audio...
📊 1-min Status: 42170 packets, 1435.2 kbps, GOOD connection
```

### Pi-Side Enhancements
```
🚀 Starting REW Pi Audio Service...
🎵 Pi Audio Receiver Started!
📡 mDNS service registered: REW-Pi-hostname._rew-audio._tcp.local.
⚠️  Dropped 3 packets (seq 1045->1049), total errors: 15
```

## 🚀 Ready for Real-World Testing

### What Works Now
1. ✅ REW virtual audio device creation and management
2. ✅ Enhanced logging shows when audio flows through the system
3. ✅ Java Bridge can connect to Pi devices (192.168.1.251 manually entered)
4. ✅ Pi receivers advertise via mDNS and respond to HTTP status requests
5. ✅ RTP streaming protocol implementation with comprehensive monitoring
6. ✅ Connection quality monitoring with health checks

### Next Steps for Full Validation
1. **Docker Environment** (requires Docker Compose installation):
   ```bash
   # Install Docker Compose, then run:
   ./test-docker-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Real Pi Hardware Testing**:
   ```bash
   # On actual Pi:
   python3 pi-receiver/rew_audio_receiver.py --verbose
   
   # On desktop with REW:
   java -jar java-audio-bridge/target/audio-bridge-*.jar --discover
   ```

3. **REW Integration Testing**:
   - Start REW software
   - Select "REW Network Audio Bridge" as output device
   - Run measurement sweeps
   - Verify audio streams to Pi devices
